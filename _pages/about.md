Hello! I'm currently a MS candidate in artificial intelligence at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology(UNIST) under Dr. KwangIn Kim.

My current researh is in the domain of computer vision, specifically in attribute recognition which is a sub-task of multi-label classification.
My masters thesis is about constructing robust pedestrian attribute recognition model via feature disentanglement using class activation map.
Also, I have expertise on weakly supervised semantic segmentation(WSSS) and collaborative filtering.

Before I joined UNIST, I took an internship at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology(DGIST), studying hyper-dimentional computing under Dr. Yeseong Kim.
During the research internship, I proposed novel object localization methods based on adversarial erasing using HD computing. 

I'm open to other research topics and opportunities, so feel free to contant me via email if you are interested in my research or just want to make conversation with me!
